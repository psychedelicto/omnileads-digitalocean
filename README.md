<p>In this repository you will find the terraform code necessary to deploy OMniLeads on digitalocean in an automated way and isolating the main components of the App in such a way that the security of business data and the ease of scaling any component prevail.</p>

## Plan

The first thing we have to do is work with the variables.

On the one hand we have general variables, then variables linked to the sizing and names of the components and finally variables linked to application parameters.
The vars.tfvars file have all parameters with their description.
